## Summary

All dependencies use permissive open-source licenses that allow:
- Commercial use
- Modification
- Distribution
- Private use

The only requirement common to all is to include the copyright notice and license text when redistributing the source code.

For binary distributions, most of these licenses (MIT, zlib, Public Domain, MIT-0) do not require attribution in the binary itself, though it is appreciated.

If you use **mbedTLS** (tcxTls addon) and choose GPL-2.0, additional obligations apply to derivative works.
